# Handling-The-Imbalance-Database
In a machine-learning algorithm to make the prediction,  balanced data-set is a must sothat  we  can  get  the  desired  output  when  we  apply  it  to  measure  parameters  like  accuracyscore,  confusion  metric,  etc.
For this project the dataset are taken from UCI and Kaggle and their link are as below one can easily download data from download tab:
